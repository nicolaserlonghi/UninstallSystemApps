Uninstall System Apps is an application that allows you to uninstall any application on your phone, even system applications, quickly and easily!
Your list of deleted applications can be exported and shared with your friends.

WHY UNINSTALL SYSTEM APPS?
  • DELETE MORE THAN ONE APP AT THE SAME TIME: one click is enough to remove all selected applications.
  • EXPORT YOUR CONFIGURATION: your custom list can be exported and imported on every device running Android.
  • SHARE YOUR LIST WITH EVERYONE: you can share your custom list with your friends and let them use it on their devices.

  Note: root permissions is required to uninstall system applications.
